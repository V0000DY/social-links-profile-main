# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile Solution

This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Through this challenge, I have not only improved my coding skills but also gained valuable insights into building responsive and interactive web components.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of several key concepts:

1. **CSS Selectors and Hover States**  
   I refined my skills in using advanced CSS selectors for styling interactive elements. Here’s an example:

```css
.profile__socials a:hover {
  background-color: var(--secondary-color);
  color: var(--background-color);
}
```

2. **Responsive Design**  
   By implementing a mobile-first approach, I ensured the layout adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes. I used `flexbox` for centering elements.

3. **Semantic HTML**  
   Structuring content with semantic tags improved accessibility and readability of the code:

```html
<main>
  <article class="profile">
    <img />
    <h2>User Name</h2>
    <p>Location</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I aim to:

- Explore CSS animations and transitions further to enhance interactivity.
- Improve naming conventions for classes to ensure better readability and maintainability.
- Dive deeper into accessibility features to create more inclusive designs.
